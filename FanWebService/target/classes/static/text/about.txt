This is a simulation of a fan controlling device. It would contain 
two temperature sensors in a vaulted two-story area, one downstairs 
in the cooler air, the other upstairs where the temperature would 
be hotter. The device would be connected to a downstairs fan
connected to a relay, and would toggle the fan on or off via 
a web service. The fan would blow cooler air upstairs, thus equalizing 
the lower and upper temperatures. In AUTO mode the fan would turn off 
when the temperatures were equal. This would allow someone to controller 
the fan from anywhere in the world.
